# Study Drills
# There are five places where a string has been inserted within a string.
# There isn't only four places, because a boolean prints a string.
# They make a longer string because we are concatenating them with the +  by adding them together.
# The strings still work with a single quote instead of a double quote because they both work, its just personal preference which one you use.
