# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal:
# `ruby day_1/exercises/variables.rb`

# Example: Write code that saves your name to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
name = "Harry Potter"
p name

# Write code that saves the string 'Dobby' to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
house_elf = "Dobby"
p house_elf

# Write code that saves the string 'Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!'
# and prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
house_elf_warning = 'Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!'
p house_elf_warning

# Write code that adds 2 to the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
students = 22
students_add_two = students + 2
p students_add_two

# Write code that subracts 2 from the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
